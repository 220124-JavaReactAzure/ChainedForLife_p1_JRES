# ChainedForLife_p1_JRES - Project 1 - Wedding Planner
## Developers 
- Joshua Robles
- Andy Escobar
## Goals
- Develop a faux wedding web app for P1
- Make a REST api for requests to be made
- Use a webpage to access and use the database
## Program Flow
- Servlet waits for requests and respondes
- Responses are handled by the service layer which later calls the DAO layer (Service layer does some checking to make sure data is valid).
- DAO layer connects to the DB and grabs or inserts data.
